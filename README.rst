Introduction
============

This is the PostgreSQL adapter for Zope 2 based on psycopg2__. Ot at least I
believe so. This code used to be in psycopg2 until the 2.4.x branch but it was
bitrotting as none of the current Psycopg maintainer uses Zope.

The current state of this project is UNMAINTAINED, although it probably
contains less bugs than the versions in Psycopg 2.4.x. If you are a Zope user
and want to contribute to this project maintenance, please contact the
`Psycopg mailing list`__.
